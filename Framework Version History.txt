TSL AsciiCommands Framework
===========================

v1.3 - 17/11/15
---------------

Framework supports ASCII Protocol 2.2.

This release provides the TSLLibraryConfiguration class to allow the UTF8 support to be enabled/disabled.
UTF8 support is now OFF by default for maximum backwards compatibility and can be turned on using the [TSLLibraryConfiguration sharedInstance].useUTF8 property.

BugFixes:

Fixed the fallback to ASCII when interpretation as UTF8 encoding fails.


v1.2 - 02/11/15
---------------

Framework supports ASCII Protocol 2.2.

This release provides no new features but be aware that error behaviour for command Select parameters has changed.

BugFixes:

TSLAsciiCommander now correctly handles UTF8 data to/from the reader - fixes issue reported with Chinese Unicode chars in Data Matrix.
Fixed an issue that could cause a crash when halting or deallocing TSLAsciiCommander
Invalid select length and offset parameters now throw TSLArgumentOutOfRangeExceptions
Added protection against a deadlock that may occur when a synchronous command is being aborted just as the command naturally finishes.
Issuing a synchronous command immediately after aborting a previous synchronous command no longer throws an exception for "already executing command"
Removed call to delegate when the end of log is detected because delegate already called when end of command detected.
Fixed bug in read log and auto run commands where moreAvailable flag was incorrect
Prevented lifecycle responseBegan from being called for non library responses when they are being ignored


v1.1 - 16/09/2014
-----------------

Framework supports ASCII Protocol 2.2:

Added TSLLicenceKeyCommand - allows a user-defined licence key to be stored on the reader.
Added TSLSleepTimeoutCommand - this sets the timeout before the reader sleeps if there are no connections to the reader

Framework now supports 64-bit platforms.

Antenna power limits are now dependent upon the currently connected device - commands with power parameters will throw an exception for invalid values

BugFixes:

TSLSwitchSinglePressCommand and TSLSwitchDoublePressCommand now correctly implements the '-x', '-p' and '-n' parameters
TSLSwitchSinglePressCommand and TSLSwitchDoublePressCommand now throw exceptions for invalid duration parameters
